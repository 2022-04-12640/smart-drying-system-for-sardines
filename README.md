# Smart Drying System for Sardines

This project uses an ATMEGA328P microcontroller to automate the drying process for sardines. It includes:

- LCD display (with PC8574 chip)
- Fan circuit
- Heater circuit (controlled by relay)
- Microcontroller logic

## Simulation
Proteus simulation files are in the `proteus_circuit` folder. These files show the full circuit setup, including microcontroller, fan, heater, relay, and LCD display.

## Code Usage
- LCD initialization and message display via `writeInLcd(col, row, "Your Message")`
- Example: `writeInLcd(0, 0, "Hello World")`

## Getting Started
1. Upload `Main.ino` to your ATMEGA328P board.
2. Use the Proteus files to simulate the circuit before hardware implementation.
3. Connect components as shown in the simulation.

For further development, add sensor and actuator code for temperature and humidity control.
