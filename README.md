# Smart Drying System for Sardines

This project uses an ATMEGA328P microcontroller to automate the drying process for sardines. The system monitors temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor, displays readings on an LCD, and controls a fan and heater based on temperature thresholds.

## Main Features

- DHT sensor for temperature and humidity
- LCD display (I2C, PC8574 chip)
- Automatic fan and heater control
- Simple LCD message function

## Simulation

Proteus simulation files are in the `proteus_circuit` folder. These show the full circuit setup: microcontroller, fan, heater (relay), and LCD display.

## Code Usage

- Temperature and humidity are displayed on the LCD
- Fan turns ON above 45째C, OFF below 35째C
- Heater turns ON at or below 35째C, OFF at or above 45째C
- Use `writeInLcd(col, row, "Your Message")` to display custom messages

## Getting Started

1. Upload `Main.ino` to your ATMEGA328P board
2. Use Proteus files to simulate the circuit before hardware implementation
3. Connect DHT sensor, fan, heater, and LCD as shown in simulation

For further development, add more sensors or actuators as needed for drying control.
